        <main><p>Growing up one of my favorite dishes was southern style
        collard greens. It was one of the few vegetables I enjoyed eating
        as a young kid. Now, an adult, collard greens are my go to dish
        when I am low on time and need something quick and full of flavor
        to eat.</p> <p>I want to highlight some of my favorite facts about
        this delicious plant. And share some of my favorite methods of cooking
        it. Are you ready? Because we are going down the collard green rabbit
        hole. Lets's go!!!</p>
